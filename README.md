# NYT-Visual

Read the article for the New York Times' open blog about NYT Visual -> https://open.nytimes.com/we-prototyped-a-news-app-to-reach-gen-z-readers-45e3c18977ba. 
NYTimes Visual is an idea that came to my mind and that I brought to reality by pitching and forming a team of talented employees for the annual NYTimes 2019 Maker Week. 


NYT Visual is a new way for the New York Times to engage with younger audiences who consume news differently through social media.   

NYT Visual addresses this gap in how our content is delivered by showcasing the expertise and talent of New York Times photographers directly. NYT Visual presents a visually rich experience based on recency and relevancy to give a sense of the news by simply scrolling through a feed of images with minimal text.   

The main idea behind this project was to introduce untapped audiences, such as millennials and generation-z members, to the broader ecosystem of the New York Times.  By connecting pictures not to a single article but to multiple related articles, the user is able to get a sense of the topic of interest by reading through different headlines of articles.
